  - "Years ago, I was chosen as the \u2018Best Doctor in the World."
  - After doing my job well for a few years, those who feared me brought corruption
    charges against me.
  - When I was taken inside, they gave me this shirt so that they could find me immediately
    in an emergency.
  - "I have no hope left\u2026 Out of respect for you, I\u2019m giving this shirt
    to you."
  - "You won\u2019t refuse, will you?"
